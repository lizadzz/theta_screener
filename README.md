## task_1: MetaMask integration

The only file which was changed in order to implement MetaMask integration was src/components/Header.jsx;
I used Web3.js which needs to be installed before proceeding, so after running:
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
we need to install web3 dependency:
npm install web3
then start the server:
npm start
as soon as the server starts running you will see a button for connecting the wallet in the header of the website.
