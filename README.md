## task_1: MetaMask integration

The only file which was changed in order to implement MetaMask integration was src/App.jsx

I used Web3.js which needs to be installed before proceeding, so after running:


npm install --legacy-peer-deps



we need to install web3 dependency:


npm install web3



then start the server:


npm start



as soon as the server is running you will be asked to connect you MetaMask wallet;
in the end of the main page you can see your connected wallet address
